# jstor-downloader
jstor-downloader downloads every single available book on the users account. I have never run this from start to finish because in 
my case I have 35,000 books available for download. This program downloads the pdfs from the book page, removes the muse cover page, 
and stiches them together as one. The completed books are stored in the books folder while the unstiched books temporarily stay in the 
temp folder where they are eventually deleted.
